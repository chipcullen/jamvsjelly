  <h1>Jams vs Jellies</h1>
  <p>A guide to cooked fruit mixtures.</p>

  <div id="jams" class="mixture">
    <h2>Jams</h2>
    <p>Jams are made by cooking crushed/chopped up fruit, along with sugar and fruit juice or water. Pectin is sometimes added to help with gelling. While seeds are commonly found in jams, it is usually free of chunks of actual fruit.</p>
    <h3>Example varities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Strawberry</li>
      <li>Grape</li>
      <li>Raspberry</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="jellies" class="mixture">
    <h2>Jellies</h2>
    <p>Jellies are made by cooking crushed/chopped up fruit, along with sugar and fruit juice or water. Pectin is added to help with gelling (moreso than with Jam). After cooking, Jelly is strained to remove all solids, leaving a clear and smooth texture.</p>
    <h3>Example varities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Strawberry</li>
      <li>Grape</li>
      <li>Mint</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="preserves" class="mixture">
    <h2>Preserves</h2>
    <p>Preserves are prepared in the same manner as Jam - they are made by cooking crushed/chopped up fruit, along with sugar and fruit juice or water. Small to large chunks of the fruit itself are left in the preserve.</p>
    <h3>Example varities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Strawberry</li>
      <li>Raspberry</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="marmalades" class="mixture">
    <h2>Marmalades</h2>
    <p>Marmalades are prepared in the same manner as <a href="#jellies">Jelly</a>. However, they are almost exclusively made from citrus fruit, and large pieces of peel are added to the mixture.</p>
    <h3>Example varities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Orange</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="fruit-butter" class="mixture">
    <h2>Fruit Butter</h2>
    <p>Fruit butter is made from the pulp of a fruit, cooked with sugar, and reduced to a thick, spreadable mixture. It is often augmented with spices.</p>
    <h3>Example varities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="conserves" class="mixture">
    <h2>Conserves</h2>
    <p>Conserves are cooked in the same manner as <a href="#jams">Jams</a>, but are combined with other ingredients, such as nuts, rasins or coconut.</p>
    <h3>Example varities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cranberry</li>
      <li>Plum</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="chutnies" class="mixture">
    <h2>Chutnies</h2>
    <p>A Chutney is most closely related to a Jam, but is distinct in many ways. First, it's quite often savory, not sweet. It is typically made with sugar <em>and</em> vinegar. It can be made with fruit, but also vegetables. It is rarely a single plant - it's usually a combination of several. It is also usually augmented with spices.</p>
    <h3>Example varities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>Mango</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
